1) Intro (20 min)

* introduction to workflows
* intro to neuroscience

2) Single-cell analysis (45 min)

New skills: reading mat files

* setting-up collaborative git repository
* choose a single mat file and load it using `scipy.io.loadmat`
* get spike times from the mat files
* write a script loading two spike train from file
* (optional) plot the spike trains
* implement a simple correlation measure
* (exercise) calculate all pairwise correlations 
* (exercise) plot the histogram

Problem:

From your collaborators you obtained more data (hurray!), but its stored
in a proprietary format. Fortunately, the hardware manufacturer provides
scripts to read the data into matlab. You would like to analyse the data
using your correlation script. How would you do that?


3) Building first workflow (45 min)

New skills: argparse, npz files, bash scripts

* use `argparse` to define parameters (input file) 
* run the script from bash
* define a new (optional) parameter for storing data
* store correlation coefficients in numpy/pickle or text
* (exercise) add `argparse` parameter - bin size
* (exercise) write script which reads correlation files and plots a histogram
* write first workflow to bash script (two lines)

Problem:

On the web you found a program that calculates efficiently correlations. It is
a closed-sourced binary (convenienty already compiled for your system) that
takes a comma-separated spike times as its input (one neuron per line) and
saves the correlations in a table stored in CSV format. How would you integrate
this tool into your workflow? How would you test its outputs?

4) Batch processing (45 min)

New skills: subprocess

* separate scripts/results/figures/workflows directories
* implement a batch processing script using `subprocess`
* (discussion) discuss strategies of linking the batch results with plotting:
    - extend batch script: batch skip can not be universal; we might not keep the intermediate single-cell results
    - extend plotting script: less flexibility in terms what is plotted and how
    - write a merge script: flexible, but causes fragmentation
    - integrate it into the automation tool : can track individual changes; works best for long-running analysis
    
* (exercise) write merge script (or add merging to plotting script)
* test scripts on command line
* (exercise) update batch script

Problem:

After running the batch analysis, you noticed that the distribution of correlation coefficient is heavily skewed. 
You blame it on faulty recordings. How would you identify the outlier recordings?

5) Automation (30 min)

New skills: make, doit, pathlib

* automation tools: Make and doit
* use doit for automation: write a simple `dodo.py` file
    * define a new task for analysing a single file
    * run the workflow (possibly with `doit -d ...`), check how deps are handled
    * use `pathlib` globing for listing all data files
    * use generator tasks to implement batch processing in `dodo.py`
    * define `task_merge_correlations`
    * (exercise) define `task_plot_correlations`
* (discussion) bash vs doit - pros and cons
* comparison with `joblib`, `scons`, `drake`, `luigi` (show sample scripts)

Problem:

One of the analysis step requires loads of computation time. You decided to "outsource" it to a computing cluster
at your insitution. How would you automate the process?

6) Extra exercises (in free time if any):

* allow the merge script to take list of files; test on two provided lists
* update plotting script to show histogram of two groups 
* update automation script
